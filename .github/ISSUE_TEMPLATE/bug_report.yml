        Any extra information that might help us investigate. For example, where are you deploying your application (Vercel, Docker, other platform)? Is it only reproducible on that platform, or locally too? Is the issue only happening in a specific browser? etc.
      placeholder: |
        I am hosting via Docker with the recommended option, and if I remove that option or try a different hosting option, I cannot reproduce the same issue.
