This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Rygent ("Developer," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and safeguards the personal information obtained through your use of the Discord bot ("Bot") developed by the Developer. By using the Bot, you consent to the data practices described in this Policy.

## Acceptance of Policy

By using the Bot or adding the bot to a Discord server, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the data collected by the Bot and does not cover the privacy practices of any third-party services or websites linked to or integrated with the Bot.

## Information Collection

a. Data Collected: The Bot collects certain data for logging and debugging purposes. This includes information such as Discord Server names, member counts, and details about the commands executed. The Bot does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) unless voluntarily provided by users.

b. Use of Cookies: The Bot does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.

## Information Use

a. Data Usage: The data collected by the Bot is used solely for the purpose of improving the Bot's performance, maintaining and debugging the system, and enhancing user experience. The collected data will never be published or shared with third-party services without your explicit consent, unless required by law.

b. Aggregated Data: We may compile aggregated, non-personal information from the data collected by the Bot for statistical analysis and reporting purposes. This aggregated data does not identify individual users and cannot be linked back to any specific individuals.

## Information Security

a. Data Protection: We take reasonable precautions to protect the data collected by the Bot from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

b. Retention: We retain the collected data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

## Third-Party Services

a. Discord Platform: The Bot operates within the Discord platform. Your use of the Bot is subject to the Discord Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of Discord for a comprehensive understanding of how your information is handled on their platform.

## Children's Privacy

The Bot is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

## Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right to update or modify this Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Policy within the Bot or on the Developer's website. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically for any updates. Your continued use of the Bot after the posting of the revised Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
